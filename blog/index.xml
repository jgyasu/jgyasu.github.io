I hope this website comes at the Nth position in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started to understand how internet works, I wanted to have my personal website. You may ask why? And I have no particular answers, perhaps I just wanted to put myself out there?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school and I did not know how to code websites, I used to use tools like Wordpress and PortfolioBox.
