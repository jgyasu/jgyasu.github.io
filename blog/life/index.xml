      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final, Final_1, Final_2, Final_3, &amp;hellip;, Final_N. I hope this website comes at the Nth position in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started to understand how internet works, I wanted to have my personal website. You may ask why? And I have no particular answers, perhaps I just wanted to put myself out there?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school and I did not know how to code websites, I used to use tools like Wordpress and PortfolioBox. They always left me dissatisfied because of how clunky and bloated they felt. But using them made me form my own philosophy around website designs - I ended up knowing what I don&amp;rsquo;t like and it is very important to know what you don&amp;rsquo;t like!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
