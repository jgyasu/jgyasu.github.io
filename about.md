I’m an undergraduate engineering student at the National Institute of Technology Agartala, India, with an interest in intelligent systems.

I enjoy contributing to open-source projects within the data science and scientific computing ecosystem. I was selected for the [European Summer of Code](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-summer-of-code) program, where I’m currently working on improving [sktime](https://www.sktime.net)’s benchmarking infrastructure. In the past, I’ve made smaller contributions to projects like scikit-image, SciPy, and others.

Previously, as a research intern at [AIISC](https://aiisc.ai), I worked on developing a watermarking model for LLM-generated content. This experience taught me how fragile automated systems can be when tasked with detecting AI-generated text.

My programming journey began in middle school, when we were taught [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) and I was fascinated by how I could create graphics with code and have the result instantaneously. That fascination led me to [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing), and I created a lot of programmed animations using it. Some of my creations are posted on a now-inactive Instagram account, [@cheesemaafia](https://instagram.com/cheesemaafia).

Beyond work and academics, I enjoy long walks, chess, music, watches, and books (except self-helps) — in no particular order.

Fun Fact: I am [mononymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym) legally, Krishnan is my preferred last name on the internet.
