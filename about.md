I am an engineering undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Agartala, India, with an interest in intelligent systems.

During my time as a research intern at [AIISC](https://aiisc.ai), I worked on creating a watermarking model for LLM-generated content and learnt how fragile it is to actually identify AI-generated text by automated systems.

I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects in the data science and scientific computing ecosystem. I was selected for the [European Summer of Code program](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-summer-of-code), where I'm working on improving [sktime](https:/www.sktime.net)'s benchmarking infrastructure. In the past, I've also contributed minorly to other projects like scikit-image, SciPy, etc.

Outside of work, I enjoy watches, chess, music, long walks, books (except self-helps) - in no particular order.
