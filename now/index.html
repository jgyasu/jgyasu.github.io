Update: November 15, 2025
These days I have been working on the benchmarking infrastructure of sktime. We want it to reach a maturity stage where any one can easily reproduce an existing benchmarking experiment and I believe we&rsquo;re quite close to our goal. This is in continuity to my project from European Summer of Code.
I am also getting interested in the use of machine learning in biology and particulary AI&rsquo;s application in drug discovery. I reached out to a professor to let me work with her and her lab and luckily she agreed. We will most probably be working on protein-lipid interactions. I will write more about it in the future." />

<p>Caught between college exams, open-source work, and life in general, I am trying to finish reading <em>Butter</em> by Asako Yuzuki, which I bought at the New Delhi airport out of boredom.</p>
