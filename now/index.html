<p><strong>Update: December 23, 2025</strong></p>
<p>Sometime in November, I received a message from my former mentor asking whether I would be interested in working on a European AI project. I decided to take it up, and I am now working on the OpenML and AIoD projects in a role slightly more senior than a trainee. The work is remote, and I expect to continue for the next two to three months before shifting my focus back to university.</p>
<p>Recently, we interviewed a few trainees for the above mentioned project, and I ended up being part of the interview panel. Being on the other side for the first time felt strange and surprisingly humbling. I could clearly sense the nervousness and excitement in the candidates, the mix of emotions I usually feel when I’m the one being interviewed :)</p>
<p>Besides work and stuff, I am actively pushing myself to get back into reading and fitness. I have picked up the book <em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em> by Haruki Murakami, let&rsquo;s see how far I go.</p>
